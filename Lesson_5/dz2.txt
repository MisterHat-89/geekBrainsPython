Ruskin Bond’s simple characters, living amidst the lush forests of the Himalayan foothills, are remarkable for their quiet heroism, courage and grace, and age-old values of honesty and fidelity. 
Residents of nondescript villages and towns, they lead lives that are touched by natural beauty as well as suffering—the loss of a loved parent, unfulfilled dreams, 
natural calamities, ghostly visitations, a respected teacher turned crooked, strangers 
who make a nuisance of themselves—which only reinforces their abiding faith in God, family and neighbour. 
Told in Bond’s distinctive style, these stories are a magnificent evocation of an India that may be fast disappearing.
